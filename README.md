# Latent Figure Protocol Generator
 
Based on Paul Vanouse's artwork [Latent Figure Protocol](https://www.paulvanouse.com/lfp.html)

> Latent Figure Protocol takes the form of a media installation that uses DNA samples to create emergent representational images. The installation includes a live science experiment, the result of which is videotaped and repeated for the duration of the gallery exhibit. Employing a reactive gel and electrical current, Latent Figure Protocol produces images that relate directly to the DNA samples used. The above images were re-produced live.  Each performance lasts approximately one hour, during which time audience members see the image slowly emerge.
Paul Vanouse, 2007
